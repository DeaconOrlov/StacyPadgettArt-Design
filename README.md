# Stacy Padgett Art & Design
> A Gallery and Commision portal

This is my final projext for the Code Louisville 2021 Monday FEWB class.

## Overview of Basic Features

- A responsive mobile menu that opens on click of a hamburger button.
- media queries to change the layout of the menu for tablet and desktop resolutions
- An email field that validates accurate email address format and returns a thanks message including the email address
- a responsive gallery page that starts on a single column layout for mobile, 3 column for tablet and 4 column for desktop

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.



## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
- Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
