# Stacy Padgett Art & Design
> A Gallery and Commision portal

This is my final projext for the Code Louisville 2021 Monday FEWB class.

## Overview of Basic Features

- A responsive mobile menu that opens on click of a hamburger button.
- The mobile menu hides content with javascript
- media queries to change the layout of the menu for tablet and desktop resolutions
- a responsive gallery page that starts on a single column layout for mobile, 3 column for tablet and 4 column for desktop
- a responsive footer with a legal copyright element that scales across the whole screen width with an nth-last-child line.

This project is something I will continue working on after this course ends as it is intended to replace the simple barebones wordpress site my wife created years ago to showcase her portfolio of work for potential employers and customers who may wish to commision her for creative work.  At present it is just hte structure that will eventually be filled in with art from her current site plus some more interactive elements as I learn more about how web design works and to practice my skills with increasingly difficult and interesting implementations of code.  I will eventually add a full order/contact form and optimize the gallery format to minimize load times and really get to play around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a way that will benefit me and her both in our future endeavours.
